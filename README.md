# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System

This project implements an intelligent **Brain Tumor Detection System** using state-of-the-art **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It is designed to analyze **brain MRI scans** and accurately detect the **presence** and **type of brain tumors**, assisting radiologists and medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
