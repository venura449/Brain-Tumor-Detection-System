# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection System

This project implements an intelligent **Brain Tumor Detection System** using state-of-the-art **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It is designed to analyze **brain MRI scans** and accurately detect the **presence** and **type of brain tumors**, assisting radiologists and medical professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 📂 Dataset

We use the publicly available [Brain MRI Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection) from Kaggle.

- Classes: `glioma`, `meningioma`, `pituitary`, `no tumor`
- Format: Grayscale MRI images
- Size: ~3000 images
